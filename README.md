Parkinson’s disease progression monitoring relies on accurate predictions of motor and non-motor symptoms, such as the total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (total_UPDRS). This project applies multiple machine learning algorithms using PyCaret’s regression module to predict total_UPDRS based on patient-specific features, excluding identifiers (subject# [ID]) and motor_UPDRS. The dataset then underwent preprocessing, model comparison, and evaluation to determine the best-performing algorithm. The results indicate that tree methods, like Random Forest and CatBoost, outperform linear models, getting lower mean absolute error (MAE) and high R² values. These findings highlight the robustness of tree-based models for clinical decision support in Parkinson’s disease management.
